# AWS Reference Architecture Classic

`aws-reference-architecture-classic` is a project that provides an example of a reference architecture in AWS (Amazon Web Services). The architecture is intended to support classic CRUD applications which rely on various application layers (presentation, service, persistence).

The architecture conforms to best practices as recommended by Amazon with regards to security, high availability, monitoring and infrastructure as code,

# CloudFormation Template

A [CloudFormation template](aws-reference-architecture-classic-template.yml) is provided which allows for the creation and destruction of the reference architecture within an AWS account.

**NOTE**: Some of the resources that are created as part of the CloudFormation templates are not part of the AWS *Free Tier* (e.g. NAT Gateway, RDS Snapshots) and will incur costs.
